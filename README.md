### About
A simple memory game. Just remember which Buildings you've clicked and which you haven't... entertainingly harder than it looks. Infinitely more so if you don't know the buidlings!

The score is calculated at the top, with the high score being logged and updated when beaten.


### Technologies 
The game was built in React, using the recommended React generation NPM/Yarn tool create-react-app. As this is a relatively simple web app, no back end technologies are needed - hence its deployment on Github pages.
